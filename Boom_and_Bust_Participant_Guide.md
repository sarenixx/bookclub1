Low rates? Capital concentration? Sovereign activity? Regulatory tailwinds? Tech breakthrough?

**Marketability**  
What makes this trend easy to trade, share, or access?

Fundraising ease? Distribution channels? ETF/SPV access? Narrative strength?

**Speculation**  
Where is speculative psychology visible?

Narrative momentum? Founder cults? Impossible TAM? Retail FOMO? Valuation disconnects?

## Bubble Antidote Builder

### Small Groups

For your trend, design one antidote strategy:

**Signal Check**  
What early-warning signs would show speculation is outrunning fundamentals?

*Examples: TAM > global GDP • 3+ competitors at 100x revenue*

**Underwriting Shift**  
What hype-resistant decision criteria would you adopt?

*Examples: Profitability path within 24 months • Discount hot-sector comps 50%*

**Balanced Conviction**  
What does bubble-aware but opportunity-positive positioning look like?

*Examples: Infrastructure, not speculation • Position-size for 70% drawdown*

### Worksheet

## The Bubble Triangle of You

### Individual Reflection

Map your personal Bubble Triangle:

**Your Fuel**  
What environments make you accelerate?

*Early momentum in data • Abundant capital for experiments • Competitive pressure • etc.*

**Your Marketability**  
What parts of your work strengthen when shared or visible?

*Public pitching improves ideas • Leadership visibility drives performance • Need external validation • etc.*

**Your Speculation Risks**  
Where do you tend toward overconfidence or FOMO?

*Chase hot opportunities outside competence • Overestimate timing ability • Can't say no when peers are enthusiastic • etc.*

### Group Discussion

Share voluntarily. Discuss:

**Team Overlaps**  
Where do multiple people share the same patterns?

*"Three of us need competitive pressure—are we vulnerable to herd behavior?"*

**Organizational Strengths/Risks**  
What patterns emerge at the team level?

*"We're marketability-driven—strong on narrative, weak on contrarian conviction."*

**Collective Productive Bubble Potential**  
How could we harness our strengths while guarding against risks?

*"We could build AI infrastructure (Fuel + Marketability) if we add speculation guardrails."*
