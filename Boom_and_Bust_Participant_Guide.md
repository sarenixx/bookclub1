## Book Discussion

Before we dive into the exercises, let's discuss the book's core framework and your reactions to it.

### The Core: The Bubble Triangle

Turner & Quinn argue that all financial bubbles can be understood using one simple framework—the **Bubble Triangle**, made of three elements:

**1. Fuel (Money & Credit)**  
Cheap, abundant capital is the accelerant.

→ Low interest rates  
→ Easy bank lending  
→ Innovations that increase liquidity (margin trading, new financial instruments)

*Without fuel, bubbles cannot grow.*

**2. Marketability**  
How easy it is to buy and sell an asset.

→ Tradable shares  
→ Good legal/market infrastructure  
→ Standardization  
→ Intermediaries promoting liquidity

*Higher marketability → faster bubble growth.*

**3. Speculation**  
The human psychology component.

→ Narratives of prosperity  
→ FOMO (fear of missing out)  
→ Overconfidence / belief that "this time is different"  
→ Herd behavior

*Speculation is what turns enthusiasm into mania.*

**Plus: "Flames" (Ignition)**  
Some spark sets things off—new technologies, political changes, regulatory shifts, major discoveries.

The authors emphasize: **bubbles aren't random—they are systematic and explainable.**

## Modern Bubble Analysis

### Choose a Trend

Your small group selects one current trend to analyze:

Generative AI • Climate tech • Private credit • Quantum computing  
GLP-1s • Longevity biotech • Sovereign wealth concentration  
*Or choose your own*

### Bubble Triangle Analysis

Analyze your chosen trend:

**Fuel**  
What's driving abundant resources into this space?

Low rates? Capital concentration? Sovereign activity? Regulatory tailwinds? Tech breakthrough?

**Marketability**  
What makes this trend easy to trade, share, or access?

Fundraising ease? Distribution channels? ETF/SPV access? Narrative strength?

**Speculation**  
Where is speculative psychology visible?

Narrative momentum? Founder cults? Impossible TAM? Retail FOMO? Valuation disconnects?

## Bubble Antidote Builder

### Small Groups

For your trend, design one antidote strategy:

**Signal Check**  
What early-warning signs would show speculation is outrunning fundamentals?

*Examples: TAM > global GDP • 3+ competitors at 100x revenue*

**Underwriting Shift**  
What hype-resistant decision criteria would you adopt?

*Examples: Profitability path within 24 months • Discount hot-sector comps 50%*

**Balanced Conviction**  
What does bubble-aware but opportunity-positive positioning look like?

*Examples: Infrastructure, not speculation • Position-size for 70% drawdown*

### Worksheet

**For trend/sector:** ___________________________

Choose one approach:

**[ ] Signal Check**

**[ ] Underwriting Shift**

**Your Fuel**  
*Early momentum in data • Abundant capital for experiments • Competitive pressure • etc.*

<br><br>

**Your Marketability**  
*Public pitching improves ideas • Leadership visibility drives performance • Need external validation • etc.*

<br><br>

**Your Speculation Risks**  
*Chase hot opportunities outside competence • Overestimate timing ability • Can't say no when peers are enthusiastic • etc.*

### Group Discussion

Share voluntarily. Discuss:

**Team Overlaps**  
Where do multiple people share the same patterns?

*"Three of us need competitive pressure—are we vulnerable to herd behavior?"*

**Organizational Strengths/Risks**  
What patterns emerge at the team level?

*"We're marketability-driven—strong on narrative, weak on contrarian conviction."*

**Collective Productive Bubble Potential**  
How could we harness our strengths while guarding against risks?

*"We could build AI infrastructure (Fuel + Marketability) if we add speculation guardrails."*
