# Boom & Bust
## Participant Guide

Turner & Quinn's *Boom and Bust: A Global History of Financial Bubbles*

---

## Overview

Today we're exploring the **Bubble Triangle**—the three conditions that create financial bubbles:

**Fuel** — Abundant capital or resources  
**Marketability** — Easy trading, sharing, or access  
**Speculation** — Psychological momentum and FOMO

We'll map this framework to personal experience, analyze current markets, and build investment guardrails.

**Duration:** 90–120 minutes

## Exercise 1: Bubble Triangle Mapping

### Individual

Using sticky notes, write one experience per note for each category:

**Fuel**  
When has abundant capital or resources shaped your work?

→ A time when capital was cheap or resources felt abundant  
→ A moment when organizational momentum created acceleration  
→ A project that grew because resources were frictionless

**Marketability**  
When has "sellability" enabled or distorted something?

→ Success driven by narrative rather than fundamentals  
→ Work that changed once it became visible  
→ Easy access creating unexpected momentum

**Speculation**  
When have you seen speculative psychology?

→ FOMO in investing or career decisions  
→ Hype cycles you participated in  
→ Enthusiasm → mania → correction

### Pairs

Share your sticky notes with your partner. Look for:

→ Overlapping patterns  
→ Contrasts (same component, different manifestation)  
→ Unexpected connections across categories

Prepare one sentence summarizing your most interesting pattern or contrast.

### Group Discussion

Each pair shares their one sentence with the full group.

## Exercise 2: Archetype Assessment

### Individual

Choose the archetype you most identify with:

| Archetype | Core Trait | Productive Side | Bubble Risk |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| **The Railway Builder** | Overestimates short-term returns but builds lasting infrastructure | Long-term value creation, visionary | Overinvestment in unproven models |
| **The Dot-Com Optimist** | Believes in transformative tech; overshoots | Early adoption, innovation bias | Ignores unit economics |
| **The Housing Believer** | Trusts systems too much; assumes stability | Process-oriented, system-builder | Blind to systemic fragility |
| **The Mississippi Gambler** | Loves novelty; overlooks systemic risk | First-mover advantage, creative | Chases hype over fundamentals |
| **The Japan 1980s Strategist** | Confidence in a system that feels unbreakable | Strong conviction, discipline | Overconfidence in past success |

### Pairs

Discuss with your partner:

1. Which archetype are you and why?
2. When has this helped you? (one example)
3. When has this created blind spots? (one example)

**Extension:** Partner Pitch  
Your partner introduces you to the group:

*"[Name] is a [Archetype]. Their strength: [X]. Their risk: [Y]."*

## Exercise 3: Modern Bubble Analysis

### Choose a Trend

Your small group selects one current trend to analyze:

Generative AI • Climate tech • Private credit • Quantum computing  
GLP-1s • Longevity biotech • Sovereign wealth concentration  
*Or choose your own*

### Bubble Triangle Analysis

Analyze your chosen trend:

**Fuel**  
What's driving abundant resources into this space?

Low rates? Capital concentration? Sovereign activity? Regulatory tailwinds? Tech breakthrough?

**Marketability**  
What makes this trend easy to trade, share, or access?

Fundraising ease? Distribution channels? ETF/SPV access? Narrative strength?

**Speculation**  
Where is speculative psychology visible?

Narrative momentum? Founder cults? Impossible TAM? Retail FOMO? Valuation disconnects?

### Scorecard

Rate each component 1–5 (low to extreme):

| Component | Score | Evidence |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Fuel | | |
| Marketability | | |
| Speculation | | |
| **Total** | | |

**Key Question:**  
If this is a bubble, is it productive (railways, dot-com) or destructive (2008 housing)?

### Group Presentation

Present your trend, scorecard, and productive/destructive assessment.

## Exercise 4: Bubble Antidote Builder

### Small Groups

For your trend, design one antidote strategy:

**Signal Check**  
What early-warning signs would show speculation is outrunning fundamentals?

*Examples: TAM > global GDP • 3+ competitors at 100x revenue*

**Underwriting Shift**  
What hype-resistant decision criteria would you adopt?

*Examples: Profitability path within 24 months • Discount hot-sector comps 50%*

**Balanced Conviction**  
What does bubble-aware but opportunity-positive positioning look like?

*Examples: Infrastructure, not speculation • Position-size for 70% drawdown*

### Full Group Discussion

Share your antidote with the full group.

Discuss: "Which antidotes apply across all investment decisions?"

## Exercise 5: The Bubble Triangle of You

### Individual Reflection

Map your personal Bubble Triangle:

**Your Fuel**  
What environments make you accelerate?

*Early momentum in data • Abundant capital for experiments • Competitive pressure • etc.*

**Your Marketability**  
What parts of your work strengthen when shared or visible?

*Public pitching improves ideas • Leadership visibility drives performance • Need external validation • etc.*

**Your Speculation Risks**  
Where do you tend toward overconfidence or FOMO?

*Chase hot opportunities outside competence • Overestimate timing ability • Can't say no when peers are enthusiastic • etc.*

### Group Discussion

Share voluntarily. Discuss:

**Team Overlaps**  
Where do multiple people share the same patterns?

*"Three of us need competitive pressure—are we vulnerable to herd behavior?"*

**Organizational Strengths/Risks**  
What patterns emerge at the team level?

*"We're marketability-driven—strong on narrative, weak on contrarian conviction."*

**Collective Productive Bubble Potential**  
How could we harness our strengths while guarding against risks?

*"We could build AI infrastructure (Fuel + Marketability) if we add speculation guardrails."*
