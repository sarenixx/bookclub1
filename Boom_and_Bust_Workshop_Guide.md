# ⭐ Boom & Bust: Interactive Book Club Exercise

**Book:** *Boom and Bust: A Global History of Financial Bubbles*  
**Authors:** John D. Turner & William Quinn  
**Format:** Individual → Duo → Small Group → Full Group Synthesis

---

## Workshop Overview

This facilitation guide translates the **Bubble Triangle framework** (Fuel, Marketability, Speculation) into interactive exercises that help participants:

- Connect bubble history to personal and professional experience
- Assess current market trends through a bubble-aware lens
- Build organizational guardrails that balance conviction with caution

**Total Time:** ~90–120 minutes

---

## 1️⃣ Bubble Triangle Mapping (Individual → Duo → Group)

**Purpose:** Understand the book's core model by translating it into personal experience and your organization's investment lens.

### Step 1 — Individual Reflection (10 minutes)

**Materials:** Sticky notes (3 colors if possible: one per bubble component)

Each person writes **one idea per sticky** for each category:

#### 🟦 A. Fuel — When has abundant "fuel" shaped your work?

**Prompts:**
- A time when capital was cheap, or resources felt abundant
- A moment when organizational momentum created acceleration
- A personal project that grew because energy/time/money was "easy to access"

#### 🟨 B. Marketability — When has marketability enabled or distorted something?

**Prompts:**
- A project/talent/company that succeeded because it was easy to "trade," share, or access
- A time when a narrative became "sellable" even if the fundamentals were shaky
- Something in your work that changed once it became highly visible

#### 🟥 C. Speculation — When have you seen speculative psychology at work?

**Prompts:**
- FOMO moments in investing or career
- A belief/hype cycle you got caught in
- A time when enthusiasm → mania → correction

**Goal:** Surface real experiences that correspond to the Bubble Triangle's three edges.

---

### Step 2 — Duo Clustering (10 minutes)

**Pair up.** Share your sticky notes and look for:

- **Overlapping patterns** — Where did you both experience similar dynamics?
- **Contrasting examples** — Where did the same component (Fuel/Marketability/Speculation) show up differently?
- **Surprise connections** — Does your partner's "Fuel" story connect to your "Speculation" moment?

**Each duo prepares:** One sentence summarizing your most interesting pattern or contrast.

---

### Step 3 — Group Share-Out (15 minutes)

Each duo shares their one-sentence pattern.

**Facilitator captures themes on a whiteboard:**
- Common "Fuel" sources in your industry/organization
- How "Marketability" creates momentum (productive or dangerous)
- Where speculation shows up most often

---

## 2️⃣ Bubble Archetype Self-Assessment (Duo Pairing)

**Purpose:** Connect bubble history to personal + professional behavior patterns.

### Individual Selection (5 minutes)

Choose **one "bubble archetype"** you most identify with:

| Archetype | Core Trait | Productive Side | Bubble Risk |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| **The Railway Builder** | Overestimates short-term returns but builds lasting infrastructure | Long-term value creation, visionary | Overinvestment in unproven models |
| **The Dot-Com Optimist** | Believes in transformative tech; overshoots | Early adoption, innovation bias | Ignores unit economics |
| **The Housing Believer** | Trusts systems too much; assumes stability | Process-oriented, system-builder | Blind to systemic fragility |
| **The Mississippi Gambler** | Loves novelty; overlooks systemic risk | First-mover advantage, creative | Chases hype over fundamentals |
| **The Japan 1980s Strategist** | Confidence in a system that feels unbreakable | Strong conviction, discipline | Overconfidence in past success |

---

### Duo Discussion (10 minutes)

**In pairs, answer:**

1. **Which archetype are you and why?**
2. **When has this helped you?** (Give one example)
3. **When has this created blind spots?** (Give one example)

---

### Optional: "Pair & Pitch" (10 minutes)

Your partner prepares a **30-second "pitch" to the group:**

> *"[Name] is a [Archetype] because [reason]. Their superpower is [strength]. Their bubble risk is [blind spot]."*

*(This mirrors the "pitching your buddy's expertise" exercise from Naval-style sessions.)*

---

## 3️⃣ Identify a Modern Bubble (Small Groups)

**Purpose:** Apply the book's framework to today's world + your organization's investment perspective.

### Group Formation (3–4 people per group)

### Step 1 — Choose a Current Trend (5 minutes)

Each group selects **one macro/industry trend** to analyze:

**Suggestions:**
- Generative AI infrastructure
- Climate tech / energy transition
- Private credit expansion
- Quantum computing
- Weight-loss pharmaceuticals (GLP-1s)
- Longevity / biotech
- Sovereign wealth fund concentration
- _(or choose your own)_

---

### Step 2 — Bubble Triangle Analysis (15 minutes)

**Answer these questions about your chosen trend:**

#### 🔵 A. What's the Fuel?

- Low interest rates?
- AI capital concentration?
- Sovereign wealth activity?
- Regulatory tailwinds?
- Technological breakthrough?

#### 🟡 B. What increases Marketability?

- Ease of raising AI rounds?
- Harmonized data models?
- ETF products?
- Reduced friction in SPVs?
- Media narrative strength?

#### 🔴 C. Where is Speculation visible?

- Narrative momentum?
- "Founder cult" moments?
- Impossible TAM assumptions?
- Retail investor FOMO?
- Valuation disconnects?

---

### Step 3 — Bubble Scorecard (5 minutes)

Rate each component from **1–5** (1 = low, 5 = extreme):

| Component | Score (1–5) | Evidence |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Fuel Intensity** | | |
| **Marketability** | | |
| **Speculative Psychology** | | |
| **TOTAL** | | |

**Then answer:**

➡️ **If this IS a bubble, is it a productive bubble (like railways/dot-com) or a destructive one (like 2008 housing)? Why?**

---

### Step 4 — Group Share-Out (15 minutes)

Each group presents:
1. Their chosen trend
2. Their bubble scorecard
3. Productive vs. destructive assessment

---

## 4️⃣ Build a "Bubble Antidote" (Group Share-Out)

**Purpose:** Identify guardrails that prevent your organization from getting swept into unhealthy bubbles while still benefiting from productive ones.

### In Your Same Small Groups (10 minutes)

For your assigned modern trend, **build one "bubble antidote" strategy:**

**Examples:**

- **Signal Check:** What early-warning sign would show speculation is outrunning fundamentals?
  - *e.g., "When TAM assumptions exceed global GDP," "When 3+ competitors raise at 100x revenue"*

- **Underwriting Shift:** What underwriting change makes hype-resistant, fundamentals-forward decisions?
  - *e.g., "Require profitability path within 24 months," "Discount comparables by 50% in hot sectors"*

- **Balanced Conviction:** What would a "bubble-aware but opportunity-positive" mindset look like?
  - *e.g., "Invest in infrastructure plays, not pure speculation," "Right-size position to tolerate 70% drawdown"*

---

### Full Group Discussion (10 minutes)

**Facilitator Question:**  
"Which of these antidotes could we apply across *all* our investment decisions—not just this trend?"

**Capture 2–3 organizational commitments.**

---

## 5️⃣ Creative Synthesis: The Bubble Triangle of You

**Purpose:** Personal reflection → Team pattern recognition → Organizational self-awareness

*(This parallels the Identity Mapping → theme clustering flow from the AVP Naval meeting.)*

---

### Individual Reflection (10 minutes)

**Create a personal Bubble Triangle:**

#### Your Fuel:
*What environments/conditions make you accelerate?*

Examples:
- "I move fastest when I see early momentum in data"
- "I thrive when capital is abundant and I can experiment"
- "I need competitive pressure to unlock my best work"

**Your answer:**

---

#### Your Marketability:
*What parts of your work become stronger when seen/shared?*

Examples:
- "My ideas improve when I pitch them publicly"
- "I perform better when my work is visible to leadership"
- "I need external validation to maintain conviction"

**Your answer:**

---

#### Your Speculation Risks:
*Where do you tend toward overconfidence or FOMO?*

Examples:
- "I chase 'hot' opportunities even when they're outside my circle of competence"
- "I overestimate my ability to time exits"
- "I struggle to say no when peers are enthusiastic"

**Your answer:**

---

### Group Discussion (20 minutes)

**Share voluntarily.** Look for:

1. **Where do we see team overlaps?**  
   *(e.g., "Three of us said we need competitive pressure to perform—does that make us vulnerable to herd behavior?")*

2. **What strengths/risks appear at the organizational level?**  
   *(e.g., "We're all marketability-driven—great for narrative, risky for contrarian bets")*

3. **What's our collective "productive bubble" potential?**  
   *(e.g., "We could harness our Fuel + Marketability to build infrastructure in AI, but need speculation guardrails")*
