# Boom & Bust
## Interactive Workshop Guide

Turner & Quinn's *Boom and Bust: A Global History of Financial Bubbles*  
Adapted for investment teams

---

**Structure:** Individual → Pairs → Small Groups → Full Group  
**Duration:** 90–120 minutes

### What You'll Do

Map the Bubble Triangle (Fuel, Marketability, Speculation) to your lived experience. Assess current market conditions. Build guardrails that distinguish productive bubbles from destructive ones.

---

## Exercise 1: Bubble Triangle Mapping
*Individual → Pairs → Group*

Translate the Bubble Triangle into personal and professional experience.

### Individual (10 min)

Sticky notes, three categories:

**Fuel** — When has abundant capital/resources shaped your work?  
→ Cheap capital moments  
→ Organizational momentum that created acceleration  
→ A project that grew because resources were frictionless

**Marketability** — When has "sellability" enabled or distorted something?  
→ Success driven by narrative rather than fundamentals  
→ Work that changed once it became visible  
→ Easy access creating unexpected momentum

**Speculation** — When have you seen speculative psychology?  
→ FOMO in investing or career decisions  
→ Hype cycles you participated in  
→ Enthusiasm → mania → correction

One experience per sticky.

### Pairs (10 min)

Share sticky notes. Look for:  
→ Overlapping patterns  
→ Contrasts (same component, different manifestation)  
→ Unexpected connections across categories

Prepare one sentence: your most interesting pattern or contrast.

### Group (15 min)

Each pair shares their sentence.  
Facilitator captures:

- Common fuel sources in your industry
- How marketability creates momentum (productive vs. dangerous)
- Where speculation appears most often

---

## Exercise 2: Archetype Assessment
*Individual → Pairs*

Connect historical bubble patterns to your decision-making style.

### Individual (5 min)

Choose one archetype:

| Archetype | Core Trait | Productive Side | Bubble Risk |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| **The Railway Builder** | Overestimates short-term returns but builds lasting infrastructure | Long-term value creation, visionary | Overinvestment in unproven models |
| **The Dot-Com Optimist** | Believes in transformative tech; overshoots | Early adoption, innovation bias | Ignores unit economics |
| **The Housing Believer** | Trusts systems too much; assumes stability | Process-oriented, system-builder | Blind to systemic fragility |
| **The Mississippi Gambler** | Loves novelty; overlooks systemic risk | First-mover advantage, creative | Chases hype over fundamentals |
| **The Japan 1980s Strategist** | Confidence in a system that feels unbreakable | Strong conviction, discipline | Overconfidence in past success |

### Pairs (10 min)

Discuss:

1. Which archetype and why?
2. When has this helped you?
3. When has this created blind spots?

**Extension:** Partner pitch (10 min)  
Your partner introduces you to the group:

*"[Name] is a [Archetype]. Their strength: [X]. Their risk: [Y]."*

---

## Exercise 3: Modern Bubble Analysis
*Small Groups (3–4)*

Apply the framework to current market conditions.

### Choose a Trend (5 min)

Generative AI • Climate tech • Private credit • Quantum computing  
GLP-1s • Longevity biotech • Sovereign wealth concentration  
*Or your own*

### Bubble Triangle Analysis (15 min)

**Fuel**  
Low rates? Capital concentration? Sovereign activity? Regulatory tailwinds? Tech breakthrough?

**Marketability**  
Fundraising ease? Distribution channels? ETF/SPV access? Narrative strength?

**Speculation**  
Narrative momentum? Founder cults? Impossible TAM? Retail FOMO? Valuation disconnects?

### Scorecard (5 min)

Rate 1–5 (low to extreme):

| Component | Score | Evidence |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Fuel | | |
| Marketability | | |
| Speculation | | |
| **Total** | | |

**Key question:**  
If this is a bubble, is it productive (railways, dot-com) or destructive (2008 housing)?

### Share-Out (15 min)

Each group presents: trend, scorecard, productive/destructive assessment.

---

## Exercise 4: Bubble Antidote Builder
*Small Groups → Full Group*

Build guardrails that distinguish productive from destructive bubbles.

### Small Groups (10 min)

For your trend, design one antidote:

**Signal Check**  
Early-warning signs that speculation is outrunning fundamentals  
*TAM > global GDP • 3+ competitors at 100x revenue • etc.*

**Underwriting Shift**  
Hype-resistant decision criteria  
*Profitability path within 24 months • Discount hot-sector comps 50% • etc.*

**Balanced Conviction**  
Bubble-aware but opportunity-positive positioning  
*Infrastructure, not speculation • Position-size for 70% drawdown • etc.*

### Full Group (10 min)

"Which antidotes apply across all investment decisions?"

Capture 2–3 organizational commitments.

---

## Exercise 5: The Bubble Triangle of You
*Individual → Group Synthesis*

Personal → Team → Organizational pattern recognition.

### Individual (10 min)

**Your Fuel**  
What environments make you accelerate?

*Early momentum in data • Abundant capital for experiments • Competitive pressure • etc.*

**Your Marketability**  
What parts of your work strengthen when shared/visible?

*Public pitching improves ideas • Leadership visibility drives performance • Need external validation • etc.*

**Your Speculation Risks**  
Where do you tend toward overconfidence or FOMO?

*Chase hot opportunities outside competence • Overestimate timing ability • Can't say no when peers are enthusiastic • etc.*

### Group (20 min)

Share voluntarily. Discuss:

1. **Team overlaps**  
*"Three of us need competitive pressure—are we vulnerable to herd behavior?"*

2. **Organizational strengths/risks**  
*"We're marketability-driven—strong on narrative, weak on contrarian conviction."*

3. **Collective productive bubble potential**  
*"We could build AI infrastructure (Fuel + Marketability) if we add speculation guardrails."*
